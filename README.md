## Spotify Dashboard App

## Front-end
For the client side, the project uses **React, TypeScript, Redux, Redux-Saga, Redux-Act and Styled Components**.

## Back-end
For the server side, **Authorization Code flow**, provided by Spotify at https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples, is used.

## Functionality
- When you search an artist, the first three albums of that artist are rendered in the **Results** sections

- When you hover on and like an album, it is added to your favorite albums on your Spotify account

- Your favorite albums are rendered on **My favorite albums** section, where you can remove an album from your favorites, which removes that album on your Spotify account as well.

- If there is a currently playing song on your Spotify account, the album cover of that song will appear on the **Currently Playing** section

- You can **play and pause** the currently playing song or **skip to the next or previous song**.
